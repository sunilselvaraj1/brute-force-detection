🎯 Hypothesis
🧠 Hypothesis Statement
During a routine maintenance window, certain devices (VMs) within the shared services cluster — responsible for DNS, DHCP, and Domain Services — were unintentionally exposed to the public internet.
Given the lack of account lockout policies on older systems, it is hypothesized that external threat actors may have:

🚨 Attempted brute-force login attacks from public IP addresses.

🔓 Successfully authenticated on vulnerable devices after multiple failed attempts.

📌 Assumptions
🌐 Devices were exposed without intended firewall restrictions (publicly reachable IPs).

🚫 No lockout thresholds were configured for failed login attempts.

🛡️ Remote logins from external IPs are considered highly suspicious unless whitelisted.

⚠️ Risk Impact
🛠️ Unauthorized access to critical infrastructure.

🔀 Lateral movement potential into internal network segments.

🧩 Compromise of DNS, DHCP, and domain management functions could lead to large-scale disruptions.

🎯 Hunt Goals
🔍 Detect external brute-force attempts (high failed login counts).

📈 Identify successful external logins following brute-force attempts.

🖥️ Determine if any sensitive assets (domain controllers, DNS servers) were compromised.
